            <p>WHO I AM</p>
            <p>My name is Saša Palinkaš. I am 25 years old, I live in Bačka Palanka, Republic of Serbia, and i am a self-taught front-end developer</p>
            <p>Front-end has been my main focus ever since i started learning programming.</p>
            <p>I enjoy the constant change in the technologies used in the area and love diving into new frameworks and technologies</p>
            <p>Spending time customizing, improving and tinkering with my work environment and tools is something I enjoy a lot, as it is something i use for many hours daily.
                It allows me to have it exactly as i desire. For intstance, I use Visual studio code as my editor of choice.
